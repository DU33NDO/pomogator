# MongoDB Migration Summary

## Overview
This project has been migrated from PostgreSQL to MongoDB with the following implementations:
- Prisma ORM with MongoDB adapter
- Mongoose for direct MongoDB interaction
- Connection to MongoDB Atlas cloud database

## Key Files
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: Updated schema using MongoDB provider
- `models/`: Mongoose models for User, Group, and Assignment
- `lib/mongoose.ts`: MongoDB connection with Mongoose
- `lib/db.ts`: Prisma client connection (unchanged but now connects to MongoDB)
- `.env`: Updated with MongoDB connection string

## API Implementation
The project now supports multiple ways to interact with MongoDB:

1. **Prisma-only routes**: Continue to use Prisma ORM with MongoDB
   - Located in existing API routes
   - No code changes needed as Prisma abstracts the database

2. **Mongoose-only routes**: Direct MongoDB interaction
   - Located in `app/api/mongoose/` directory
   - Uses Mongoose models and schema validation

3. **Hybrid approach**: Using both Prisma and Mongoose
   - Located in `app/api/hybrid/` directory
   - Example of leveraging both ORMs in the same API

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Set up MongoDB connection in `.env`
3. Generate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
4. Start the application: `npm run dev`

## Benefits of Using Both Prisma and Mongoose
- **Prisma**: Type safety, auto-generated types, simple CRUD operations
- **Mongoose**: Rich schema validation, middleware, hooks, direct MongoDB query capabilities
- **Combined**: Seamless migration path, flexibility for complex queries with Mongoose while maintaining Prisma for simpler operations
